---------------------------------------

Collapse all tool windows except the ones you really need visible and gain 10-33% faster Visual Studio startup times and a fresh starting point every day.

Select which of the known high-performance tool windows to leave docked when all others will auto-hide. 

Choose between:

* Command Window
* Error List
* Output Window
* Solution Explorer
* Task List
* Toolbox

The fewer tool windows docked on startup, the better the performance. So, if all tool windows were un-docked (collapsed), you got zero negative performance impact from tool windows.
